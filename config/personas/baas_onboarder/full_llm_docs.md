# undefined: Introduction

Deploy AI for video meetings through a single unified API.

**Meeting Baas** üêü provides _Meetings Bots As A Service_, with integrated transcription.

This allows you to:

1. **interact with**
2. **transcribe**
3. **AI summarize**

video-meetings through a single unified API. Using Meeting Baas, you can deploy bots on Microsoft Teams, Google Meet, and Zoom in less than 1 minute.

Our meeting bots behave just like any other attendee of a meeting ‚Äì except they won‚Äôt talk. _For now._

Bots can hear and see other people talking, read and write in the chat, and present themselves with a name and a profile picture.

Just provide a meeting URL through a simple command, and meeting bots will connect to the meeting, give their name and ask to be let in.

Once inside, they record the meeting until it ends, and provide you with the data as they go.

# undefined: Getting the data

Learn how to receive and process meeting data through webhooks, including live events and post-meeting recordings

To get your meeting data, listen for POST requests to the webhook URL you set up in your account.
There you'll get two types of data:

-   **live meeting events**, as the bot interacts with the meeting. Right now, the events supported share bot status updates.

-   **post-meeting data:** the video-recording, speech time events, ...

### 1. Live Meeting Events

The events we send you during the meeting are in the following format:

```http
POST /your-endpoint HTTP/1.1
Host: your-company.com
Content-Type: application/json
x-meeting-baas-api-key: YOUR-API-KEY

{
  "event": "bot.status_change",
  "data": {
    "bot_id": "asfdgfdewsrtiuydsfgklafsd",
    "status": {
      "code": "joining_call",
      "created_at": "2024-01-01T12:00:00.000Z"
    }
  }
}
```

Here we have:

-   `event`: The key-value pair for bot status events. Always `bot.status_change`.

-   `data.bot_id`: The identifier of the bot.

-   `data.status.code`: The code of the event. One of:

    -   `joining_call`: The bot has acknowledged the request to join the call.

    -   `in_waiting_room`: The bot is in the "waiting room" of the meeting.

    -   `in_call_not_recording`: The bot has joined the meeting, however it is not recording yet.

    -   `in_call_recording`: The bot is in the meeting and recording the audio and video.

    -   `call_ended`: The bot has left the call.

-   `data.status.created_at`: An ISO string of the datetime of the event.

### 2. Success webhook

To get the final meeting data, listen for POST requests to the webhook URL you set up in your account.&#x20;

You either get:

-   &#x20; `"event": "complete",`

or

-   &#x20; `"event": "failed".`

Here's an example for a `complete event`, assuming `[https://your-company.com/your-endpoint](https://your-company.com/your-endpoint)` is your webhook URL:

```http
POST /your-endpoint HTTP/1.1
Host: your-company.com
Content-Type: application/json
x-meeting-baas-api-key: YOUR-API-KEY

{
  "event": "complete",
  "data": {
    "bot_id": "asfdgfdewsrtiuydsfgklafsd",
    "mp4": "https://bots-videos.s3.eu-west-3.amazonaws.com/path/to/video.mp4?X-Amz-Signature=...",
    "speakers": ["Alice", "Bob"],
    "transcript": [{
      "speaker": "Alice",
      "words": [{
        "start": 1.3348110430839002,
        "end": 1.4549110430839003,
        "word": "Hi"
      }, {
        "start": 1.4549110430839003,
        "end": 1.5750110430839004,
        "word": "Bob!"
      }]
    }, {
      "speaker": "Bob",
      "words": [{
        "start": 2.6583010430839,
        "end": 2.778401043083901,
        "word": "Hello"
      }, {
        "start": 2.778401043083901,
        "end": 2.9185110430839005,
        "word": "Alice!"
      }]
    }]
  }
}
```

Let's break this down:

-   `bot_id`: the identifier of the bot.

-   `mp4`: A private AWS S3 URL of the mp4 recording of the meeting. Valid for one hour only.

-   `speakers`: The list of speakers in this meeting. Currently, this requires the transcription to be enabled. Stay tuned :sunny:

-   `transcript | optional`: The meeting transcript. Only given when `speech_to_text` is set when asking for a bot. An array of:

    -   `transcript.speaker`: The speaker name.

    -   `transcript.words`: The list of words. An array of:
        -   `transcript.words.start`: The start time of the word.
            -   `transcript.words.end`: The end time of the word.
            -   `transcript.words.word`: The word itself.

### 3. Failed webhook

Here's an example of a failed recording:

```http
POST /your-endpoint HTTP/1.1
Host: your-company.com
Content-Type: application/json
x-meeting-baas-api-key: YOUR-API-KEY

{
  "event": "failed",
  "data": {
    "bot_id": "asfdgfdewsrtiuydsfgklafsd",
    "error": "CannotJoinMeeting"
  }
}
```

The failure types can be:

| Error                 | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

| TimeoutWaitingToStart | The bot has quit after waiting to be accepted. By default this is 10 minutes, configurable via `automatic_leave.waiting_room_timeout` or `automatic_leave.noone_joined_timeout` (both default to 600 seconds). |
| BotNotAccepted        | The bot has been refused in the meeting.                                                                                                                                                                       |
| InternalError         | An unexpected error occurred. Please contact us if the issue persists.                                                                                                                                         |
| InvalidMeetingUrl     | The meeting URL provided is not a valid (Zoom, Meet, Teams) URL.                                                                                                                                               |

Let's break this down:

-   `meeting_url`: The meeting URL to join. Accepts Google Meet, Microsoft Teams or Zoom URLs. (Required)
-   `bot_name`: The display name of the bot. (Required)
-   `reserved`: (Required)
    -   `false`: Sends a bot from our pool of _always ready_ meeting bots, immediately. Beware that **demand might temporarily be higher than the number of currently available bots**, which could imply a delay in the bot joining. When possible, prefer the true option which reserves an instance of an AI meeting bot.
    -   `true`: Reserves in advance a meeting bot for an upcoming meeting, ensuring the presence of the bot at the start of the meeting, typically for planned calendar events. You need to **call this route exactly 4 minutes before the start of the meeting**.
-   `bot_image`: The URL of the image the bot will display. Must be a valid URI format. Optional.
-   `recording_mode`: Optional. One of:
    -   `"speaker_view"`: (default) The recording will only show the person speaking at any time
    -   `"gallery_view"`: The recording will show all the speakers
    -   `"audio_only"`: The recording will be a mp3
-   `entry_message`: Optional. The message the bot will write within 15 seconds after being accepted in the meeting.
-   `speech_to_text`: Optional. If not provided, no transcription will be generated and processing time will be faster.
    -   Must be an object with:
        -   `provider`: One of:
            -   `"Default"`: Standard transcription, no API key needed
            -   `"Gladia"` or `"Runpod"`: Requires their respective API key to be provided
        -   `api_key`: Required when using Gladia or Runpod providers. Must be a valid API key from the respective service.
-   `automatic_leave`: Optional object containing:
    -   `waiting_room_timeout`: Time in seconds the bot will wait in a meeting room before dropping. Default is 600 (10 minutes)
    -   `noone_joined_timeout`: Time in seconds the bot will wait if no one joins the meeting

Additional optional parameters:

-   `webhook_url`: URL for webhook notifications
-   `deduplication_key`: String for deduplication. By default, Meeting Baas will reject you sending multiple bots to a same meeting within 5 minutes, to avoid spamming.
-   `streaming`: Object containing optional WebSocket streaming endpoints (16kHz):
    -   `output`: WebSocket endpoint to receive audio stream from the meeting
    -   `input`: WebSocket endpoint to stream audio back into the meeting
-   `extra`: Additional custom data
-   `start_time`: UTC timestamp (uint64) for scheduled start time

This request will respond with the identifier of the bot you just created:

```http
HTTP/2 200
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "bot_id": 42
}
```
